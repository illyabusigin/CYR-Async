Purpose
--------------

Asynchronous GCD utilities for Objective-C inspired by https://github.com/caolan/async.

Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) has made handling asynchronous operations on iOS an absolute delight. However, certain asynchronous operations can still be a bit cumbersome. CYR+Async aims to extend GCD to help solve the some of the more common asynchronous use cases not covered by GCD.
